# Facial Emotion Classification (CNN)

## Objective
- Prepare and preprocess image data for emotion classification.
- Explore dataset characteristics
- Train a CNN model to classify facial expressions into predefined emotion categories.
- Use data augmentation to improve generalization.
-  Evaluate the model’s performance using multiple metrics and visual tools.
-  Visualize predictions, highlight misclassified samples, and interpret model behavior.
-  Save the best-performing trained model and all generated visualizations.
-  Document all steps clearly
  
## Dataset Description
  The dataset used in this task is called "FER-2013 (Facial Expression Recognition 2013) " [1] that's contains 35,887 centered 48 × 48-pixel grayscale face images labeled with one of seven emotions clesses(Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral). The training set consists of 28,709 examples and the public test set consists of 3,589 examples. This dataset is  widely used for developing and evaluating models in facial emotion recognition.
